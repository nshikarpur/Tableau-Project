This project is on Tableau.

In this Tableau project, a comprehensive visualization was crafted using a CSV/Excel file containing 35 columns of employee details,
including age, experience, and various personal attributes. Leveraging Tableau's intuitive interface and powerful visualization tools, 
the dataset was transformed into insightful visualizations that provided a holistic view of the employee landscape. Through interactive
dashboards and dynamic filters, users could explore key metrics such as age distribution, experience levels across departments, 
and correlations between different personal attributes. Additionally, advanced analytics features within Tableau allowed for deeper analysis, 
such as identifying trends over time, detecting outliers, and uncovering patterns within the data. This project not only facilitated a better 
understanding of the employee demographics but also empowered stakeholders to make data-driven 
decisions related to talent management, workforce planning, and organizational development.
